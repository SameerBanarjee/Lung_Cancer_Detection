# Lung_Cancer_Detection

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and predict lung cancer, aiming to provide early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes. By analyzing medical reports data, environmental factors, and patient records,  this system seeks to identify patterns indicative of lung cancer, supporting healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the numerical dataset containing the daily life factor of a person including the diet, pollution level, etc and patient data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies critical features from numerical data using techniques like filtering and clustering.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines to predict the likelihood of lung cancer.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilizes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
- **User Interface**: A simple, user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and view predictions.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning models
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- **Tools**:
  - Google Colab for development and testing
  - Git for version control

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes medical reports data, environmental and daily life factors and patient data available on public websites. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Results
The project achieves a high accuracy of prediction, with detailed evaluation metrics. Visualization of model performance, such as ROC curves and confusion matrices, is included.
